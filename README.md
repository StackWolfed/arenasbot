# Where to put the token
Create a file named `secret.py` with a variable named `token` like this:

secret.py
```py
token = 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
```

## Python version
Uses **python 3.7** and the rewrite version of `discord.py`

## Things I used
- SQLite3 (local database on a file, easier to manage for this kind of project, no sequirity needed)
- Asyncronous programming
